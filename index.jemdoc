== Bio
I received my B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014, under the supervision of [http://ncrl.seu.edu.cn/2017/0620/c17542a191997/page.htm Prof. Wei Xu]. In Aug. 2018, I received my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering (ECE) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China, under the supervision of [https://www.ece.ust.hk/~eekhaled/ Prof. Khaled B. LETAIEF] and [http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~jeiezhang/ Prof. Jun ZHANG]. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Institute for Digital Communications (IDC) at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany. I am supported by the prestigious *Humboldt Research Fellowship*, hosted by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uu0BpX8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra Prof. Robert Schober]. My research interests include millimeter wave communications, MIMO systems, mathematical optimization, large intelligent surface-assisted communications, and stochastic geometry. I co-authored the book /Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Multi-Antenna Wireless Networks/ (Springer, 2019). I also received the *IEEE GLOBECOM 2017 Best Paper Award*, the *2018 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award*, and the *IEEE GLOBECOM 2019 Best Paper Award*.
